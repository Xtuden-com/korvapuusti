# Data

This directory contains all partial loudness data.

## Raw Data
This folder contains the raw labels of each of the four listeners for all the partial loudness data as well as the ISO reproduction examples.

## Preprocessed Data
This folder contains the data processed into various formats and split in different sets; the training set, the within-distribution test set, and the three out-of-distribution test sets.
Additionally, the folders `all_nm_data` and `all_dl_data` contains the data preprocessed in a format that can be used by Nelder-Mead optimization and deep-learning respectively. The latter contains all features extracted with Fourier transforms and CAR-FAC.
